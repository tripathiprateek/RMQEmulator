# RMQEmulator
This is a generic emulator with with Cloud MQ and REST APIs
The goal here is to provide developers with a emulator framework which will use Cloud AMPQ as messaging queue and a local  http server which will act as a REST api server to emulate response.
So you can use this framework to emulate messages to the cloudampq and then use the client to read thoese messages and use built in REST apis emulator to get response.
